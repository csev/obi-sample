==========

This is a very very simple badge management system for the Open Badges Project 
in PHP

This is being moved to be 2.0 compliant - the old 1.1 code is in the
folder `obi1_1`

You can play with an online version of this here http://www.dr-chuck.com/obi-sample/

Here is a free site to make a nice 3D badge with an image http://www.onlinebadgemaker.com/

Notes
-----

Issuer.id must always by an HTTP(s) IRI, but badgeclass.id doesn't have to be, and
assertion.id only has got to be a URL for hosted verification
